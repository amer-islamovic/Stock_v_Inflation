## Features
- Use an API to pull in data - Lines 59 and 93 
- Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to do things like remove 0’s and null values where they don’t belong - Lines 135 and 162 
- Do 5 basic calculations with Pandas, like finding the sum(), median(), mean(), or mode() of a column. You could divide two columns by each other. You could multiple a column by a random integer. You could use string operations and find the most common letter in a given entry. - 130, 140 and 167 
- Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting. - Line 194 
- Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code. If you make a few plots with matplotlib, explain what the reader is seeing and why you chose to plot things that way. - Notes every few lines through the project.
